# Technical Blog Template
This is a technical blog template inspired by [my blog post](https://simonberens.dev/blog/starting-a-technical-blog-in-2023/). It uses
[Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) for default styling as well as the static site generation pipeline.

- **Easily write latex in your blog posts**
- Home page that automatically shows your blog posts in chronological order
- Beautiful styling, especially for code blocks

3. Update the site title and description in `.vitepress/config.ts`.
4. Create new a post with `pnpm new`.
